#  Prototype Pattern for Efficient Invoice Generation
## Problem Statement
You are tasked with creating an API for invoice generation and testing. While testing, generating invoices from scratch
by fetching data from a database is time-consuming, as retrieving a single invoice already takes several seconds.
When you need to generate a large number of invoices for testing purposes, this approach becomes impractical.
To optimize the testing process, you decide to implement the Prototype pattern. This pattern allows you to create
prototype invoice objects and efficiently clone them as needed, significantly reducing the time and resources required
for invoice generation during testing.

### Assignment
Your assignment is to implement the Prototype pattern to create prototype invoice objects for efficient testing.
You should define an ObjectClonable interface that contains the clone method, which should be implemented by invoice
objects. Additionally, you need to create an InvoicePrototypeRegistry interface that provides methods for adding and
retrieving invoice prototypes and for cloning invoice objects. The primary objective is to streamline the process of
generating invoices for testing, making it faster and more resource-efficient.

### Implementing the Prototype Pattern
Define the ObjectClonable interface: Create an interface named ObjectClonable with a single method, clone(),
that returns a cloned copy of the implementing object.

 Implement the invoice object: Implement the Invoice class with attributes like invoiceId, customerName, amount,
dueDate, and invoiceType. Ensure that the Invoice class implements the ObjectClonable interface by providing a proper
clone method that creates a deep copy of the invoice object.

Define the InvoicePrototypeRegistry interface: Create an interface named InvoicePrototypeRegistry that includes methods
for adding prototypes, retrieving prototypes by type, and cloning invoice objects.

Create the registry implementation: Implement a class that adheres to the InvoicePrototypeRegistry interface. In this
class, manage a collection of invoice prototypes and provide methods to add prototypes, retrieve prototypes by type,
and clone invoice objects based on their type.

Test your implementation: Write test cases to ensure that the Invoice class correctly implements the ObjectClonable
interface and that the registry class properly manages prototypes and performs cloning operations. Verify that cloning
an invoice object results in a new object with the same attribute values but is not the same object in memory.
